"""Structured event log: ``events.jsonl`` writer + SQLite mirror.

Implements the §4 observability contract from the implementation guide.
Every state-changing operation emits exactly one :class:`Event` that is
appended to the per-job ``events.jsonl`` (append-only, atomic-line) and
mirrored to the cross-job ``events`` table for SQL queries.

Both writes are performed in :func:`emit`. JSONL is written first because
it's the canonical tail target the future UI subscribes to; the SQL row is
the secondary index. If the SQL insert fails we re-raise — but the JSONL
line is already on disk and a future tailer will see it.

The ``schema_version`` field is part of the §14 hard-to-change-later list:
bumped when the on-disk format changes incompatibly.
