"""Research loop — task runner with retry, follow-ups, and synthesis cadence.

Implements §6.1 of ``research-agent-implementation-guide.md``: a single
``while not job.should_stop() and not plan.is_complete()`` loop that pulls
the next pending task from the SQLite queue, dispatches it through a
``kind → handler`` registry, and records the outcome.

The loop has three resilience boundaries:

* :class:`~research_agent.orchestrator.errors.RetriableError` — handlers
  raise this for transient failures; the loop applies a tenacity backoff
  (waits ``RETRY_WAITS`` seconds, ``RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`` total attempts).
* :class:`~research_agent.orchestrator.errors.FatalError` — the task is
  marked ``failed`` and the loop continues with the next task. One bad
  task does not kill the daemon.
* ``MAX_TASKS_PER_JOB`` hard cap — anti-runaway guard from §6.3. When hit
  the loop stops and best-effort triggers a final synthesis pass so the
  user gets *something* back even if the planner went off the rails.

Synthesis and critique cadence is driven by ``HEURISTIC_CHECK_EVERY_N``
(every 25 tasks) — real heuristics live with the synthesis/critique
modules; the loop just calls handlers if registered. Failures in those
heuristic-driven calls are emitted as ``warning`` events but never abort
the loop.

The single entry point is :func:`run_loop`. It accepts an optional
``handlers`` registry override (used by tests + for swapping connector
implementations) and an optional explicit ``plan`` (otherwise the latest
``plans`` row for the job is loaded).
