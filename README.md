# muckwire

## What is this and why does it exist?

Existing AI research agents are cloud-only, opaque about where their answers
came from, and lock you into one vendor. **muckwire** is a different
shape: a CLI daemon that runs on your laptop, defaults to local models via
LM Studio (so the wallet cost is `$0`), and treats every claim as something
that has to land in a footnote with a Wayback archive URL behind it.

You hand it a goal — *"Compare Pydantic AI, LangGraph, and CrewAI"*,
*"Profile this contractor for due diligence"*, *"Track Project 2025
implementation across federal agencies"* — and walk away. A planner spawns
worker tasks (fetch, extract, dedup, classify), findings accumulate in a
per-job folder with a SQLite index, a synthesizer rewrites a `report.md`
with inline citations, a critic on a different model pushes back, and the
whole thing runs under a deterministic job ID with `start` / `status` /
`stop` / `resume` lifecycle commands a sysadmin would recognize.

**Who it's for:** investigative journalists, security researchers,
due-diligence work, anyone who needs to kick off a multi-hour run overnight
and wake up to a report with citations they can defend.

**What it's NOT:** a chatbot, a real-time tool, or the right answer to a
one-off question you could resolve with a single web search.

## The name

**muckwire** carries the spirit of the **muckrakers** — the Progressive
Era journalists (roughly 1890–1920) who exposed corruption in government,
the predations of big business, and the social injustices nobody in power
wanted documented. Ida Tarbell dismantled Standard Oil claim by claim.
Lincoln Steffens mapped the machinery of municipal graft. Upton Sinclair
walked readers onto the meatpacking floor. Ida B. Wells indicted lynching
in statistics nobody could wave away. Jacob Riis and Lewis Hine
photographed tenements and child labor until the country had to look.
Theodore Roosevelt coined the term in 1906 as an insult — borrowed from
Bunyan's *Pilgrim's Progress*, a man so busy raking muck he never looked
up — and the journalists wore it as a badge of honor. Their work drove
the Pure Food and Drug Act, antitrust enforcement, child-labor laws, and
most of the accountability infrastructure that survives today.

The **"wire"** half points at the plumbing of that same tradition — the
wire services (AP, Reuters, UPI) that moved an investigation from one
city to readers in another by morning. This tool is built for the same
kind of work: patient, sourced, evidence-first investigation. Every
claim it produces lands in a footnote with a Wayback archive URL behind
it, because the only thing that survives the pushback is the receipts.

## Direct connector kinds

The planner can dispatch directly to any of the connectors below instead
of falling back to `web_search` with a `site:` operator. Each row here
mirrors what the planner sees in its system prompt — same description,
same optional payload knobs, same example query. The table is generated
from `src/research_agent/tools/_registry.py` via
`scripts/regen_readme_kinds.py`; do not hand-edit between the sentinels.

# Investigation Report: Project 2025 Implementation Tracker

## Executive Summary

- **Active Regulatory Shifts:** The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers are
  currently in a public comment period (open through January 5, 2026)
  regarding the revision of "Waters of the United States" (WOTUS)
  definitions following the *Sackett v. EPA* ruling [40, 99].
- **Health Policy Revisions:** Significant proposals within Project 2025
  target HHS and the CDC, including reversing FDA approvals for abortion
  medication (mifepristine), restructuring the CDC into two separate
  agencies, and implementing Medicaid work requirements [38, 43, 44, 116].
- **Expansion of Executive Authority:** The blueprint advocates for
  "unitary executive theory," aiming to place the federal bureaucracy
  under direct presidential control [38, 87].

## Hypotheses

### H1: Identify core policy pillars and specific proposals
**Status:** Confirmed
- **Supporting:** The investigation identified key pillars including
  abortion access restrictions (Comstock Act), immigration overhaul,
  voting rights limitations, and the expansion of executive power [37, 38].

## Open Questions

- **Specific Implementation Dates:** While IRS workforce downsizing is
  noted, the exact timeline for the "quiet cuts" remains unverified [127].

## Recommended Human Follow-Ups

### FOIA candidates
- Correspondence between the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers regarding
  the "wet season" definition in the proposed WOTUS rule [40, 98].

Bracketed numbers in the body resolve to the numbered list at the bottom.
Each source row carries the canonical URL, the resolved title, and the
retrieval date. Wayback archive URLs are mirrored alongside in
`jobs/<job-id>/sources/` so a deleted page is still defensible.

## Install

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Playwright browsers (installed via `playwright install chromium` below)
- `tesseract` (optional but recommended) — enables the PDF OCR escalation
  layer for scanned FOIA responses and image-PDF court filings. Without
  it, those documents silently return degraded text.
  - macOS: `brew install tesseract`
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install tesseract-ocr`

```bash
# editable install with dev extras
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# one-time browser bootstrap (binaries are not pip-installable)
playwright install chromium

# create your local .env from the template
cp .env.example .env
```

`.env` is the only place runtime secrets and operator overrides live — no
`export` required. Lookup order, highest precedence first:

1. Existing process env vars (CI, one-shot `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... research ...`).
2. `./.env.local` (gitignored, dev-only overrides).
3. `./.env` (or the nearest ancestor walking up to repo root).

The full list of recognized keys lives in `src/research_agent/config.py`
(`EXPECTED_ENV_KEYS`). `.env.example` and `research doctor` both read from
that list, so there is no drift.

### Required / commonly used

| Key | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | yes | Cloud synthesis tier (Claude Opus / Haiku via OpenRouter). |
| `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` | no | Brave Search API key (free tier ~2000 queries/month). When set, `web_search` engine `auto` picks Brave over the DDG-Playwright scraper. |
| `LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL` | no | Override the default `http://localhost:1234/v1`. |
| `RESEARCH_HEADFUL` | no | Set to `1` to launch Playwright in headed mode for debugging. |
| `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` | no | YouTube Data API v3 key (free quota: 10,000 units/day). When set, `tools/youtube.py:search` uses the official API; absent, it falls back to scraping the public results page via Playwright. |

### Connector-specific and advanced

<details>
<summary>Click to expand — escalation toggles, connector API keys, broker switches</summary>

| Key | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `RESEARCH_USER_AGENT` | no | Override default UA sent by httpx + Playwright. |
| `RESEARCH_IGNORE_ROBOTS` | no | Set to `1` to bypass robots.txt checks in `web_fetch`. |
| `RESEARCH_PDF_VLM_ESCALATION` | no | Set to `1` to enable Opus 4.7 vision escalation for PDFs that fail every cheaper layer. Off by default — costs real money; emits a `pdf_vlm_escalation` WARN event when fired. |
| `RESEARCH_OCR_VLM_ESCALATION` | no | Set to `1` to enable Opus 4.7 vision escalation for image OCR when Tesseract and the local VLM both fail. Off by default — costs real money; emits an `ocr_vlm_escalation` WARN event when fired. |
| `RESEARCH_DAEMON_PROGRESS` | no | Set to `0` to suppress the foreground Rich progress bar the daemon writes to stdout when run interactively. |
| `RESEARCH_FRAGMENT_SYNTH` | no | Set to `1` to enable experimental section-fragment synthesis. Unset keeps the legacy whole-report synthesizer. |
| `COURTLISTENER_API_TOKEN` | no | CourtListener API token (free w/ signup) — required by `tools/courtlistener.py`. Authenticated tier is 5,000 req/hr; anonymous traffic is throttled to the point of unusability. |
| `DATA_GOV_API_KEY` | no | api.data.gov key (free w/ signup at <https://api.data.gov/signup/>) — used by `tools/fec.py`, `tools/congress.py`, and `tools/smithsonian.py`. FEC/Congress/Smithsonian fall back to `DEMO_KEY` for low-volume smoke when unset. |
| `LDA_API_KEY` | no | Senate Lobbying Disclosure Act API key (free, optional, register at <https://lda.senate.gov/api/register/>) — used by `tools/lda.py`. Anonymous works for low-volume; authenticated raises rate limits. Sent via `Authorization: Token <key>`. |
| `OPENCORPORATES_API_KEY` | no | OpenCorporates API token — used by `tools/opencorporates.py`. **Required for any live request:** anonymous v0.4 access is now gated (returns HTTP 401), so without a key the connector returns no results and smoke skips cleanly. Token rides as `?api_token=<key>`. Public-benefit access by emailing service desk; commercial pricing £2,250–£12,000/yr. |
| `OPENALEX_API_KEY` | no | Free OpenAlex API key — used by `tools/openalex.py`. Optional for low-volume smoke/demos; recommended for regular use since the February 2026 free-key policy. Sent as `?api_key=<key>`. |
| `TROVE_API_KEY` | no | Trove/National Library of Australia API key — used by `tools/trove.py`. Keys expire after 12 months and require renewal by email. Sent as `X-API-KEY`, not a URL parameter. Connector defaults to metadata-only; no automatic full-text downloads. |
| `NARA_API_KEY` | no | National Archives Catalog OPA v2 API key — used by `tools/nara.py`. Request by emailing `Catalog_API@nara.gov`; registration takes about 24h. Sent as `x-api-key`. Default limit is 10,000 queries/month; connector and smoke skip cleanly when unset. |
| `DPLA_API_KEY` | no | Digital Public Library of America API key — used by `tools/dpla.py`. Request with `curl -X POST https://api.dp.la/v2/api_key/<your-email>`; the emailed 32-character key is sent as `?api_key=<key>`. Connector and smoke skip cleanly when unset. |
| `EUROPEANA_API_KEY` | no | Europeana API key — used by `tools/europeana.py`. Create a free key in your Europeana account under Manage API keys (migrated there on 2025-05-28). Sent as `?wskey=<key>` to `https://api.europeana.eu/api/v2/search.json`; connector enforces 1 RPS and smoke skips cleanly when unset. |
| `SERPAPI_KEY` | no | SERPAPI key — required by `tools/scholar.py` (Google Scholar engine, case law + academic). Plans start at $75/mo for 5k searches across all engines; per-query ≈ $0.015. Sign up at <https://serpapi.com/>. |
| `LINKEDIN_DATA_API_KEY` | no | LinkedIn data-broker key (default broker: Proxycurl) — required by `tools/linkedin.py`. Per-lookup ≈ $0.01–$0.05; gate fetches behind explicit planner tasks. Sign up at <https://nubela.co/proxycurl/>. |
| `LINKEDIN_BROKER` | no | Broker recipe used by `tools/linkedin.py`. `proxycurl` (default) or `lix`; switching to `lix` consults `LIX_API_KEY` instead of `LINKEDIN_DATA_API_KEY`. |
| `LIX_API_KEY` | no | Lix data-broker key (<https://lix-it.com/>) — only consulted when `LINKEDIN_BROKER=lix`. Similar per-lookup pricing to Proxycurl. |
| `RESEARCH_REDDIT_USER_AGENT` | no | Override the User-Agent `tools/reddit.py` sends. Reddit's anonymous JSON endpoint 403s the project's descriptive UA; the connector defaults to a Chrome UA. Set this when you have a registered OAuth app or want a different override than `RESEARCH_USER_AGENT` (consulted next in the fallback chain). |
| `RESEARCH_MODELS_CONFIG` | no | Path to the models routing YAML the daemon loads. Defaults to `config/models.yaml` relative to cwd. Set when running out-of-tree or pointing at a packaged config. |
| `RESEARCH_DB_PATH` | no | Override the SQLite index path the daemon uses. Unset uses `data/index.sqlite`. Useful for isolating runs under test or pointing at a writable disk. |
| `RESEARCH_JOBS_ROOT` | no | Override the directory that holds per-job folders. Unset uses `jobs/`. Useful for redirecting big runs onto a larger disk. |
| `SANCTIONS_DB_PATH` | no | Override where `tools/sanctions.py` writes its SDN/EU index sqlite. Unset uses the module default under `data/sanctions/`. Useful when refreshing into a staging path before atomic swap. |

</details>

## LM Studio

Local tiers run through [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) at
`http://localhost:1234/v1`. The exact model identifiers the router maps to
each tier live in [`config/models.yaml`](config/models.yaml); never
hardcode model names elsewhere — pick a tier.

**Models to download** (LM Studio UI → Discover → search by exact ID):

| Tier | Model ID | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `fast` | `josiefied-qwen3-4b-instruct-2507-abliterated-v2` | Classification, dedup, language detection. |
| `general` | `qwen3.6-35b-a3b-holo3-qwopus-instruct-qx64-hi-mlx` | Worker default — query rewriting, extraction, summarization. |
| `reasoner` | `deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b` | Hypothesis ranking, contradiction detection. |
| `vision` | `deepseek-ocr-2` | PDF page screenshots, chart reading. |
| `embeddings` | `qwen3-embedding-4b-dwq` | Semantic search across findings + sources (768-d output). |

After downloading, start the LM Studio local server (Developer tab →
Server → Start). The default port is `1234` and the OpenAI-compatible
endpoint mounts at `/v1`. Override with `LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL` if you've
moved it (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:1234/v1` for a workstation across the
LAN).

`embeddings` intentionally has no cloud fallback — a stall surfaces as a
hard error rather than silently rerouting to a chat model. Keep
`qwen3-embedding-4b-dwq` loaded any time you plan to use `research search`
or the daemon's hybrid retrieval. After upgrading from a release that
shipped the older 1024-d `qwen3-embedding-4b` model, drop
`data/index.sqlite` or re-index any job with persisted embeddings — the
new model emits 768-d vectors and existing rows will mis-shape on
read-back.

## OpenRouter

Cloud tiers go through [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/). Create a key
(Dashboard → Keys → Create Key) and paste it into `.env`:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
```

The key drives three tiers:

| Tier | Model | When it fires |
|---|---|---|
| `frontier` | `anthropic/claude-opus-4-7` | Major synthesis, critique, final report, planner rewrites. |
| `frontier_alt` | `moonshotai/kimi-k2-1t` | Critique pass — diverse second opinion. |
| `frontier_speed` | `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` | Fast cloud calls when local isn't enough but Opus is overkill; intake follow-ups; tier fallback. |

`research doctor` sanity-checks the key shape (`sk-or-` prefix) without
hitting the network. List prices live in `config/models.yaml` under
`pricing:` and feed the budget tracker (`src/research_agent/llm/budgets.py`).

## `research doctor`

```bash
research --help
research --version          # print package version
research doctor             # environment readiness checks (Rich table)
research doctor --json      # same report as machine-readable JSON
```

`research doctor` is the canonical wiring check. It verifies:

- Python ≥ 3.12 and the `.env` files that were loaded.
- Every key in `EXPECTED_ENV_KEYS` (presence + masked tail).
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` shape (`sk-or-` prefix).
- LM Studio reachability at `LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL` (optional check, never required).
- `data/` and `jobs/` exist and are writable.
- SQLite WAL mode is selectable.
- `config/models.yaml` parses.

Required failures exit non-zero (safe to wire into CI as a pre-flight
gate). Optional skips (LM Studio unreachable, optional env keys missing)
never affect the exit code.

## Walk-through

End-to-end: from clean repo to a finished report.

```bash
# 1. Verify the stack.
research doctor
# All required checks should be green. LM Studio "skip" is fine if you're
# only running cloud tiers; "fail" on OPENROUTER_API_KEY is not.

# 2. Start a job. The daemon runs detached; control returns immediately.
research start --skip-intake \
    --goal "Compare Pydantic AI, LangGraph, and CrewAI" \
    --budget-usd 5.00 \
    --time-cap 24 \
    --disk-cap-gb 10 \
    --inbox
# → Started job 2026-05-02-compare-pydantic-ai- (daemon pid 12345).
#   Tail logs with: research logs 2026-05-02-compare-pydantic-ai- -f

# 3. See what's running.
research list                          # newest first

# 4. Watch progress live.
JOB=$(research list --json | jq -r '.[0].id')
research status "$JOB" --watch         # Rich panel, refreshes every 2s

# 5. Tail events as they fire.
research logs "$JOB" -f

# 6. Read the report when synthesis lands (auto-rewrites as it iterates).
research view "$JOB" --report          # opens $EDITOR on a TTY

# 7. Stop early if you want — graceful by default.
research stop "$JOB"                   # daemon finishes current task, then synthesizes
research stop "$JOB" --kill            # hard SIGTERM/SIGKILL escalation

# 8. Resume from the last checkpoint after a crash or a clean stop.

## Directory layout

### Per-job folder (`jobs/<job-id>/`)

Every job is a self-contained folder. The cross-job DB only mirrors
metadata for fast queries — the folder is the source of truth. The
field-level contract is documented in
[`docs/JOB_FOLDER_CONTRACT.md`](docs/JOB_FOLDER_CONTRACT.md).

```
jobs/<job-id>/
├── job.json              # canonical metadata (id, goal, status, timestamps)
├── intake.json           # frozen intake answers
├── goal.md               # human-readable goal + scope
├── plan/                 # planner state (versioned)
├── findings/             # findings/NNNNNN.md (zero-padded, monotonic)
├── sources/              # symlinks/copies of canonical source markdown
├── synthesis/            # synthesis/NNNN.md (versioned)
├── fragments/            # fragments/<section>/NNNN.md (versioned)
├── critique/             # critique/NNNN.md (versioned)
├── artifacts/            # structured outputs such as CSV tables
├── coverage.json         # enumeration coverage ledger, when required
├── inbox/                # optional human-supplied documents for live ingest
│   └── processed/        # ingested inbox files, renamed with content hash
├── report.md             # current report (rotated to report.history/ on rewrite)
├── report.history/       # archived prior reports
├── events.jsonl          # append-only event log
├── INBOX_REPLAN.json     # transient replan trigger after inbox ingest
├── daemon.pid            # written on spawn, removed on clean exit
├── daemon.out.log        # daemon stdout
├── daemon.err.log        # daemon stderr
└── STOP                  # presence signals graceful stop request
```

Job IDs are deterministic: `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>` derived from the intake
goal. All on-disk writes go through atomic `*.tmp` + `os.replace` so a
crashed process never leaves half-written sidecars.

### Cross-job state (`data/`)

```
data/
├── index.sqlite          # WAL-mode; jobs, findings, sources, llm_calls, FTS5, embeddings
├── index.sqlite-wal
├── index.sqlite-shm
└── llm_cache.sqlite      # LLM response cache (separate file for safe wipe)
```

`research config cache-clear` wipes `llm_cache.sqlite` (and its `-wal`/
`-shm` sidecars) without touching `index.sqlite`.

### Gitignored regenerable dirs

`jobs/`, `runs/`, `data/`, `logs/`, `sessions/`, `.alpha-loop/`, `.venv/`.
Lockfiles (`uv.lock`) are committed.

```

`research start` runs interactive intake (or accepts `--skip-intake --goal
"..."` as a non-interactive testing back door), creates the job folder +
DB row, and spawns a detached daemon via
`subprocess.Popen(start_new_session=True)`. The PID is written atomically
to `jobs/<id>/daemon.pid`; the daemon's stdout/stderr land in
`jobs/<id>/daemon.{out,err}.log`.

`--inbox` enables a live `jobs/<id>/inbox/` watcher for the daemon. Files
added with `research inbox <job-id> add <file>` are indexed into the local
corpus, moved to `inbox/processed/`, logged as `corpus_doc_added`, and
used to trigger a tactical replan while the daemon is still running.

`--input-csv PATH --artifact NAME --key COL` imports an existing CSV into
`jobs/<id>/artifacts/` before the daemon starts so a run can enrich missing
cells instead of creating a list from scratch. Repeat `--key` or pass
comma-separated key columns. Use `--target-column COL` to restrict enrichment
to specific columns, repeating it or passing comma-separated names as needed.
Existing non-empty cells are preserved by default; `--update-existing`
records overwrite intent in intake metadata.

`--translate-non-english` is off by default. When enabled, extracted
findings whose source metadata is non-English get a
`findings/NNNNNN.translation.md` English mirror via `frontier_speed`; the
original finding remains unchanged. Plan YAML can also opt in per task
with `payload.translate_non_english: true`. See
[`docs/CONFIG.md`](docs/CONFIG.md) for the per-job knob and budget
behavior.

`--fragments` enables experimental section-fragment synthesis for a job by
setting `RESEARCH_FRAGMENT_SYNTH=1` for the spawned daemon and recording
`"fragments": true` in `intake.json`. Leaving it unset keeps the legacy
whole-report synthesis path.

`research search` defaults to a hybrid pass: FTS5 on `findings_fts` /
`sources_fts` plus semantic cosine over `embeddings` blobs, deduped and
fused via reciprocal-rank fusion (k=60). Pass `--fts-only` for a
keyword-only escape hatch (useful when LM Studio is offline or for
debugging FTS5 syntax).

`research export` bundles a job for sharing. `--zip` walks
`jobs/<job-id>/` into a `ZIP_DEFLATED` archive; `--md-bundle` concatenates
intake, `report.md`, every finding, and the source list into one navigable
markdown file; `--csv <artifact-name>` exports a structured table artifact
from `jobs/<job-id>/artifacts/` with stable column order and empty cells
for missing optional values. Exactly one mode flag is required. When
structured artifacts exist, synthesis links them from the report instead
of relying on prose-only list output.

`research compare` diffs two runs by counts (tasks, findings, sources,
plan versions, drain-replans, cornerstone hits), department coverage, and
source-host frequency. Each `<ref>` is either a live job id or a path to
a `report.md` (works on archived copies under `jobs/<id>/archive/` even
after the job's DB rows are gone). Re-running `research start` against the
same goal auto-archives the prior `report.md` into that folder so this
command always has something to compare against; pass `--fresh-reset` to
opt back into the legacy "fail on collision" behavior.

### Config verbs

```bash
research config cache-clear        # wipe data/llm_cache.sqlite
```

The LLM response cache lives in its own SQLite file, keyed on
`(provider, model, prompt, sampling-params, tool-defs)` with a 30-day
default TTL. The router opts in per call (`cache=True`) — deterministic
extractions opt in, exploratory synthesis opts out.

### Hidden smoke verbs

`_smoke-llm` and `_smoke-tool` are operator/CI helpers, hidden from
`--help` but stable enough to script against. See
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for usage.

## Costs

Local LM Studio inference is free at the wallet (the cost is the GPU/CPU
time on your laptop). All dollar spend goes through OpenRouter via the
`frontier`, `frontier_alt`, and `frontier_speed` tiers.

### Realistic per-run dollar ranges

The default cap on `research start` is `--budget-usd 5.00`. Typical
spend for a single run, depending on goal scope and aggressiveness:

| Run shape | Typical spend | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Quick recon (≤ 1 hr, ~50 tasks) | $0.10 – $1.00 | Mostly local; one or two cloud syntheses. |
| Half-day investigation (~4 hr) | $1 – $5 | Several synth + critique passes; cap defaults handle this. |
| 24-hour soak (Phase 6 fixture) | $5 – $25 | Set `--budget-usd 25.00` for the full soak per `tests/integration/test_phase6_soak_24h.md`. |

The exact ratio depends on how often the planner triggers cloud calls,
which models actually serve them (Opus is ~25× the price of Haiku per
output token), and whether the LLM cache returns hits.

### What triggers cloud calls

In rough order of frequency:

- **Synthesis passes** — `frontier` for major checkpoints, `frontier_speed`
  as a budget-aware fallback if `frontier` would tip over the cap.
- **Critique** — `frontier_alt` is preferred so the synthesizer and critic
  disagree productively.
- **Adaptive intake follow-ups** — `frontier_speed` for short clarifying
  turns during interactive intake.
- **Local-tier fallbacks** — when an LM Studio tier times out or returns a
  `RateLimitError`, the router routes to the tier's `fallback_tier`. This
  is the only path where a "local-looking" task quietly costs money;
  watch for `tier_fallback` events in `events.jsonl` if your spend looks
  high.

### How the budget cap behaves

The cap is enforced in `src/research_agent/llm/budgets.py` at the
OpenRouter wrapper — every cloud call passes through it; no direct
OpenRouter clients exist elsewhere.

- **Soft warning at 90 %.** A single `WARNING` log fires the first time
  spend crosses 90 % of the cap. Use it as your "wrap up" signal if
  watching live.
- **Hard stop at 100 %.** `BudgetTracker.precheck()` raises
  `BudgetExceeded` before the next cloud call ships. The loop catches it,
  emits `cap_hit`, and triggers a **final-pass synthesis** on the cheaper
  `frontier_speed` tier so the user gets a report. If even
  `frontier_speed` would blow the cap, a template stub is rendered from
  on-disk findings without any LLM call (per issue #39).
- **State survives restarts.** `BudgetTracker` re-hydrates `spent` from
  `jobs.cost_so_far_usd` at construction, so a daemon restart picks up
  the same running total.
- **Local tiers are free.** `cost_usd = 0.0` for local rows in
  `llm_calls`; only OpenRouter tiers are priced. Pricing is read from
  the `pricing:` block in `config/models.yaml` (manually maintained).

## Compared to other research tools

The questions you're going to ask (and that issue reporters will ask):
*"why not LangGraph / CrewAI / Gemini Deep Research / Perplexity?"* Honest
answer is "because they're solving slightly different problems" — laid
out so you can pick the right tool for what you're doing:

| | muckwire | LangGraph | Gemini Deep Research | Perplexity Pro |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Runs locally | ✅ | ⚠️ framework — you provide infra | ❌ | ❌ |
| $0 default cost | ✅ | depends | ❌ | ❌ subscription |
| Source attribution + Wayback archival | ✅ | manual | ⚠️ partial | ✅ |
| Multi-hour unattended runs | ✅ | manual | ❌ | ❌ |
| CLI lifecycle (`start` / `stop` / `resume`) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Per-job folder + cross-job index | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Cost cap enforcement | ✅ | manual | ❌ | n/a |
| Pre-built agentic primitives | ❌ build-your-own | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Conversational UX | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

If you want a chat box that answers a single question, use Perplexity. If
you want to wire a graph by hand, use LangGraph. If you want to hand a
CLI a goal and walk away with a defensible report eight hours later,
that's the niche this project is in.

## Roadmap / known limitations

The 🚧 callout above is honest, but vague. Specifics, in priority order:

- **Single-machine only.** v1 ships single-host; no multi-machine /
  distributed coordination is on the roadmap. A "control plane" would be
  a separate project.
- **No web UI.** CLI-first is intentional — operators run this over SSH
  on a workstation overnight. A read-only status dashboard might land
  later but is not committed.
- **macOS / Linux only.** LM Studio runs on macOS (MLX) or Linux/Windows
  (CUDA), but the daemon's lifecycle code (`launchd` plist, `caffeinate`
  guidance, `softwareupdate`) is only documented for macOS. Linux works
  but needs equivalent `systemd-inhibit` wiring; Windows is untested.
- **Cost model drifts.** OpenRouter pricing in `config/models.yaml` is
  manually maintained — provider price changes don't auto-sync. Run
  `research doctor --json` and compare against the OpenRouter dashboard
  if your spend looks off.
- **Connector buildout is in flight.** Issue [#107](../../issues/107) is
  the connector epic; [#158](../../issues/158) is the active smoke-fix
  sweep against the post-#107 bug list (anonymous-tier breakages,
  request-shape regressions, env-var skip behavior). Expect intermittent
  smoke skips on niche connectors until that closes.
- **Synthesizer can close subgoals too aggressively.** Tracked at
  [#159](../../issues/159) — broad-scope subgoals sometimes terminate
  overnight runs early. Workaround: phrase the goal narrowly, or run with
  a longer `--time-cap`.
- **`completion_reason` mislabel.** Tracked at
  [#160](../../issues/160) — clean subgoal closes are labeled
  `user_stopped` rather than `goal_complete`. Cosmetic but misleading
  in `research status` output.

Bug reports are how this list shrinks — open an issue if you hit
something not on it.

## macOS hygiene

A 24-hour soak on a laptop has three failure modes that aren't bugs in
the daemon: idle sleep, OS auto-reboot, and you closing the lid in the
wrong way. Address them once, up front.

### Prevent idle sleep — `caffeinate -i -w <pid>`

After `research start` returns, capture the daemon PID and tie a
`caffeinate` to it from a second terminal:

```bash
DAEMON_PID=$(cat jobs/<job-id>/daemon.pid)
caffeinate -i -w "$DAEMON_PID" &
```

- `-i` blocks **idle sleep** specifically (the display can still dim,
  which is fine — the soak doesn't need pixels).
- `-w <pid>` ties caffeinate's lifetime to the daemon. When the daemon
  exits — graceful stop, kill, or crash — caffeinate auto-exits with it,
  so there's no orphan process holding the system awake.

Long activity gaps in `events.jsonl` are usually idle-sleep, not a bug
in the daemon. On non-macOS hosts, use the equivalent for your OS (e.g.
Linux `systemd-inhibit --what=idle`).

### Disable auto-reboot for system updates

macOS will silently install and reboot for security updates by default.
A reboot mid-soak loses the daemon and leaves a stale PID file behind.
Either:

- **GUI:** System Settings → General → Software Update → Automatic
  Updates → toggle off "Install macOS updates" and "Install Security
  Responses and system files".
- **CLI:**
  ```bash
  sudo softwareupdate --schedule off
  ```

Re-enable after the soak finishes if you want the OS to keep itself
patched.

### Optional `launchd` plist for auto-resume on boot

If a reboot does happen (power loss, manual restart), you can have the
most recent running job auto-resume. Drop a launch agent at
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.alpha.research.resume.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>com.muckwire.resume</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/bin/bash</string>
    <string>-lc</string>
    <string>cd /path/to/muckwire &amp;&amp; \
            JOB=$(./.venv/bin/research list --json --status running 2>/dev/null \
                  | /usr/bin/python3 -c 'import json,sys; jobs=json.load(sys.stdin); print(jobs[0]["id"]) if jobs else None') &amp;&amp; \
            [ -n "$JOB" ] &amp;&amp; ./.venv/bin/research resume "$JOB"</string>
  </array>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key>
  <true/>
  <key>StandardOutPath</key>
  <string>/tmp/research-resume.out.log</string>
  <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
  <string>/tmp/research-resume.err.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Load it once: `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.muckwire.resume.plist`.
Edit `/path/to/muckwire` to your checkout. Inspect
`/tmp/research-resume.{out,err}.log` if a boot doesn't pick up the job
you expected.

## Troubleshooting

### `research doctor` failures

| Failure | What to do |
|---|---|
| `python: fail` | Install Python 3.12+ (`brew install python@3.12`) and rebuild the venv. |
| `env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY: missing (required)` | Add the key to `.env`. Restart any open shell so the new value is picked up. |
| `openrouter_key_shape: fail` | Key doesn't start with `sk-or-` — copy it again from the OpenRouter dashboard. |
| `lm_studio: skip ... not reachable` | Optional, but local tiers won't work. Start LM Studio, click Server → Start, confirm port `1234`. |
| `writable_dirs: fail` | `data/` or `jobs/` permissions issue. `mkdir -p data jobs && chmod u+rwx data jobs`. |
| `sqlite_wal: fail` | Stdlib SQLite is too old or the temp dir is read-only. Re-run on a writable partition. |
| `models_yaml: fail` | `config/models.yaml` was edited and no longer parses. `git diff config/models.yaml` to inspect. |

When in doubt: `research doctor --json | jq .` for a structured view that
omits the Rich formatting.

### Smoke commands

Two hidden verbs verify the LLM stack and tool registry without spinning
up a job:

```bash
# Single structured-output call against one tier in config/models.yaml.
research _smoke-llm fast "Say hello"
research _smoke-llm general "Say hello"
research _smoke-llm reasoner "Say hello"
research _smoke-llm frontier "Say hello"
research _smoke-llm frontier_alt "Say hello"
research _smoke-llm frontier_speed "Say hello"

# Skipped (exit 0) without --image; reports `output: skipped: vision: no image provided`.
research _smoke-llm vision "Describe this" --image path/to/page.png

# Bypasses Pydantic AI; hits /embeddings directly. Reports `output: dim=<N>`.
research _smoke-llm embeddings "vector me"

# Tool registry probes (Phase 3 connectors).
research _smoke-tool web_search "muckraker investigative journalism"
research _smoke-tool web_fetch "https://example.com/article"
research _smoke-tool arxiv "transformer interpretability"
research _smoke-tool news "federal reserve"
research _smoke-tool trove_search "White Australia Policy"
research _smoke-tool commons_search "Algerian war photographs"
```

`web_fetch` prints the resolved title, the path that served the fetch
(`httpx` vs `playwright`), HTTP status, word count, the Wayback archive
URL (when Save Page Now completed in time), and the first 200 characters
of cleaned text. A missing `archive_url` is not a fetch failure —
Wayback archival is fire-and-forget.

### Where to read events

- `research logs <job-id> -f` — formatted tail of `events.jsonl` (level
  filter via `--level ERROR`).
- `jobs/<job-id>/events.jsonl` — raw append-only JSON, one event per
  line. `jq` is your friend (`jq 'select(.level=="ERROR")' events.jsonl`).
- `jobs/<job-id>/daemon.err.log` — daemon stderr (uncaught exceptions,
  process-level errors that didn't make it to `events.jsonl`).
- `data/index.sqlite` — cross-job mirror of events / findings / sources /
  llm_calls. Open with `sqlite3 data/index.sqlite` for ad-hoc queries.

### Disk cap

Each job has a per-job disk cap (default `10` GB, override with
`--disk-cap-gb`). The daemon polls `jobs/<id>/` every 5 minutes; when
total usage exceeds the cap, it scores every linked source by
`5 * findings_usage + 1 * fts_title_hits − 0.1 * age_days` and prunes
the lowest-scored 10 % until usage drops below 90 % of the cap. A single
`WARN`/`warning` event marks the cap crossing; one `INFO`/`source_pruned`
event fires per file removed. Pruned ≠ banned: the `sources` row stays
in the cross-job index with `md_path = NULL`, and a future fetch with
the same sha256 transparently re-creates the file under the current job.

## End-to-end testing

The Phase 4 "done when" gate is exercised manually — too heavy and too
cost-bearing for CI. See `tests/integration/test_phase4_e2e.md` for the
playbook (canonical fixture goal, driver script, AC verification
commands, and a triage table for common failures).

The Phase 5 (4-hour daemon-lifecycle soak) and Phase 6 (24-hour
real-goal soak) gates have their own playbooks alongside it:
`tests/integration/test_phase5_lifecycle.md` and
`tests/integration/test_phase6_soak_24h.md`. Phase 6 also captures its
results in `tests/integration/soak_24h_postmortem.template.md` (copy
the `.template.md` to a dated file for your specific run rather than
overwriting the template).
